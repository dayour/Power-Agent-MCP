# Security Audit Summary - Critical Issues Overview

## Audit Summary Report

**Project**: Power Platform Build Tools  
**Audit Date**: $(date)  
**Total Issues Found**: 5

## Issue Breakdown by Severity

### ðŸ”´ HIGH SEVERITY (1 issue)
- **BUG-002**: Path Traversal Vulnerabilities
  - **Risk**: System compromise, unauthorized file access
  - **Priority**: IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM SEVERITY (3 issues)
- **BUG-001**: OIDC Token URL Information Disclosure
- **BUG-003**: Insufficient Input Validation  
- **BUG-004**: Generic Error Handling Information Disclosure

### ðŸŸ¢ LOW SEVERITY (1 issue)
- **BUG-005**: Unsafe Type Casting Patterns

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Within 1 week):
1. Fix path traversal vulnerabilities in file handling
2. Review and sanitize all debug logging
3. Enhance input validation for service connections

### Short-term (Within 1 month):
1. Implement secure error handling patterns
2. Remove unsafe type casting across all tasks
3. Add security-focused test cases

### Long-term (Within 3 months):
1. Establish regular security audit schedule
2. Implement automated security scanning
3. Enhance developer security training

## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level**: MODERATE

The codebase has a solid foundation but requires security hardening. No critical vulnerabilities were found that would require immediate service shutdown, but the identified issues should be addressed promptly to maintain security standards.

## Files Requiring Attention

1. `src/params/auth/getCredentials.ts` - Information disclosure
2. `src/host/BuildToolsHost.ts` - Path traversal  
3. `extension/service-connections.json` - Input validation
4. All task implementations - Error handling and type safety
