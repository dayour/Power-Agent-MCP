# ENHANCE-001: Enhanced Error Messages with Troubleshooting Guidance

## Priority: High
## Category: User Experience Enhancement  
## Impact: Improved user productivity and reduced support burden
## Effort: Medium

### Enhancement Description:
The current error messages, while functional, could be significantly enhanced to provide more descriptive information and actionable troubleshooting guidance to help users resolve issues more efficiently.

### Current State:
```typescript
// Example of current generic error handling
catch (error) {
    tl.setResult(tl.TaskResult.Failed, error);
}
```

### User Experience Impact:
- **Current**: Generic error messages that require investigation
- **Enhanced**: Descriptive errors with specific troubleshooting steps
- **Benefit**: Faster issue resolution and improved developer experience
- **Support Reduction**: Fewer support tickets due to clearer guidance

### Proposed Enhancement:
1. **Descriptive Error Messages**: Provide context-specific error descriptions
2. **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Include common resolution steps
3. **Documentation Links**: Reference relevant documentation sections
4. **Diagnostic Information**: Include helpful context without sensitive data

### Example Implementation:
```typescript
catch (error) {
    const enhancedMessage = `
Failed to export solution '${solutionName}':
${error.message}

Troubleshooting steps:
1. Verify the solution name exists in the target environment
2. Check that you have sufficient permissions
3. Ensure the environment URL is correct

`;
    tl.setResult(tl.TaskResult.Failed, enhancedMessage);
}
```

### Benefits:
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Faster problem resolution
- **Reduced Support Burden**: Self-service troubleshooting capability
- **Better Documentation**: Contextual help where needed
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Less time spent debugging common issues

### Implementation Scope:
- All 32 tasks would benefit from enhanced error messaging
- Focus on common failure scenarios first
- Prioritize tasks with highest usage frequency

### Success Metrics:
- Reduced support ticket volume
- Faster task failure resolution time  
- Improved user satisfaction scores
- Higher task success rates
