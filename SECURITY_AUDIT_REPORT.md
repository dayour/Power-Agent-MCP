# Security Audit Report - Power Agent MCP

**Audit Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Auditor:** Security Assessment Tool  
**Scope:** Complete codebase security review for private keys, access tokens, and sensitive information  

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was conducted on the Power Agent MCP codebase to identify and remediate potential security vulnerabilities related to credential exposure, hardcoded secrets, and insecure authentication handling.

**Overall Security Rating:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM RISK** (after fixes)  
**Critical Issues Found:** 1 (FIXED)  
**High Priority Issues:** 0  
**Medium Priority Issues:** 2  
**Low Priority Issues:** 3  

## üö® Critical Issues (FIXED)

### 1. Credential Logging Vulnerability (CRITICAL - FIXED)

**Location:** `src/mcp/standalone-server.ts:559`  
**Issue:** PAC CLI commands containing passwords and client secrets were being logged in plain text  
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Credentials could be exposed in logs, CI/CD systems, and console output  

**Vulnerable Code (BEFORE):**
```typescript
console.error(`Executing: ${cmd}`);
// This would log commands like:
// "pac auth create --password "mypassword" --clientSecret "mysecret""
```

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Sanitize command for logging to prevent credential exposure
const sanitizedCmd = this.sanitizeCommandForLogging(cmd);
console.error(`Executing: ${sanitizedCmd}`);

private sanitizeCommandForLogging(cmd: string): string {
  let sanitized = cmd;
  sanitized = sanitized.replace(/--password\s+"[^"]+"/gi, '--password "[REDACTED]"');
  sanitized = sanitized.replace(/--clientSecret\s+"[^"]+"/gi, '--clientSecret "[REDACTED]"');
  // Additional patterns for comprehensive protection
  return sanitized;
}
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Strengths Identified

### 1. Proper .gitignore Configuration
- `.env` files are properly excluded from version control
- Sensitive file patterns are appropriately ignored

### 2. Existing Error Sanitization
- `ErrorHandler.ts` contains robust secret sanitization patterns:
  ```typescript
  private static sensitivePatterns = [
    /password[=:]\s*[^\s&]+/gi,
    /token[=:]\s*[^\s&]+/gi,
    /secret[=:]\s*[^\s&]+/gi,
    /key[=:]\s*[^\s&]+/gi,
    /authorization[=:]\s*[^\s&]+/gi,
    /bearer\s+[^\s&]+/gi
  ];
  ```

### 3. Environment Variable Usage
- Credentials are properly externalized using environment variables
- `.env.example` provides template without actual secrets

### 4. No Hardcoded Secrets Found
- No API keys, tokens, or passwords found hardcoded in source code
- No private keys or certificates committed to repository

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Priority Issues

### 1. Git Authentication Token Handling
**Location:** `setGitAuthn.js:23-26`  
**Issue:** Git PAT token handling for CI/CD operations  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Recommendation:** Ensure this script is only used in secure CI/CD environments

### 2. Authentication Parameter Exposure in Tool Schemas
**Location:** `src/mcp/standalone-server.ts:313-324`  
**Issue:** Password and clientSecret parameters are exposed in tool schemas  
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Note:** This is expected behavior for MCP tools but should be noted for security awareness

## üîç Low Priority Issues

### 1. Console Logging Patterns
**Status:** Monitor for any additional logging that could expose sensitive data

### 2. Third-Party Dependencies
**Recommendation:** Regular security audits of npm dependencies using `npm audit`

### 3. Authentication Caching
**Location:** `src/utilities/CacheManager.ts`  
**Note:** Verify secure handling of cached authentication tokens

## üìã Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** Fix credential logging vulnerability
2. ‚úÖ **COMPLETED:** Implement command sanitization for logging

### Short-term Actions (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
1. Add automated security scanning to CI/CD pipeline
2. Implement secret scanning in pre-commit hooks
3. Regular dependency vulnerability assessments

### Long-term Actions (LOW PRIORITY)
1. Consider implementing credential encryption for caching
2. Add security headers for any web-based components
3. Regular security training for development team

## üîß Security Controls Implemented

### 1. Command Sanitization
- Added `sanitizeCommandForLogging()` method
- Redacts passwords, client secrets, and other sensitive parameters
- Maintains audit trail while protecting credentials

### 2. Pattern-based Secret Detection
- Comprehensive regex patterns for various credential types
- Applied to error handling and logging contexts

## üìä Audit Methodology

### Tools and Techniques Used:
1. **Static Code Analysis:** Manual review of all source files
2. **Pattern Matching:** Regex searches for common secret patterns
3. **Git History Review:** Checked for accidentally committed secrets
4. **Configuration Analysis:** Reviewed all config files and templates
5. **Dependency Scanning:** Examined third-party package dependencies

### Files Audited:
- All TypeScript/JavaScript files (`.ts`, `.js`)
- Configuration files (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`)
- Environment templates (`.env.example`)
- Documentation files (`.md`)
- Build and deployment scripts

## üèÅ Conclusion

The Power Agent MCP codebase demonstrates good security practices overall, with one critical vulnerability that has been successfully remediated. The existing error handling framework shows security awareness, and the use of environment variables for credential management follows industry best practices.

**Key Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Critical credential logging vulnerability fixed
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets found in codebase
- ‚úÖ Proper .gitignore configuration maintained
- ‚úÖ Environment variable best practices followed

**Next Steps:**
- Implement automated security scanning
- Regular security audits for dependencies
- Monitor logs for any credential exposure patterns
