[![Official Build](https://dev.azure.com/dynamicscrm/OneCRM/_apis/build/status%2FDPX-Tools%2Fpowerplatform-build-tools%20Official%20Build?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/dynamicscrm/OneCRM/_build/latest?definitionId=15006&branchName=main)

**Power Agent MCP** is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes all Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools AND SQL Server database operations as AI-accessible tools. This enables AI assistants like Claude to interact naturally with both Power Platform environments and SQL databases, automating complex DevOps workflows and data operations through simple conversational commands.

**Now Enterprise Production Ready** with 100% PAC CLI coverage validation, comprehensive testing, production deployment guides, and integrated SQL Server capabilities.

## üöÄ What is Power Agent MCP?

Power Agent MCP transforms Power Platform operations and SQL database management by providing:
- **Natural Language Interface**: Control Power Platform and SQL Server through AI conversations
- **Complete DevOps Coverage**: All 32 Power Platform Build Tools as MCP tools
- **SQL Database Operations**: Full CRUD operations and schema management for SQL Server
- **Enterprise Ready**: Production-grade authentication and error handling
- **Zero Learning Curve**: No need to memorize CLI commands, SQL syntax, or parameters

Power Agent MCP automates common build and deployment tasks including solution metadata synchronization between development environments and source control, generating build artifacts, deploying to downstream environments, provisioning/de-provisioning of environments, performing static analysis checks using the PowerApps checker service, and managing SQL Server databases with natural language commands.

Each MCP tool wraps the existing [Power Platform CLI](https://aka.ms/PowerPlatformCLI) and SQL Server operations with AI-friendly interfaces.

## üéØ Key Features

- **39 AI-Accessible Tools**: Complete coverage of all Power Platform Build Tools functionality PLUS 7 SQL Server tools
- **10 Functional Categories**: Environment management, solution development, deployment, governance, SQL database operations, and more
- **Enterprise Authentication**: Service Principal, Managed Identity, and Workload Identity Federation support for Power Platform; Connection string authentication for SQL Server
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, async operations, and audit trails
- **Zero Configuration**: Works with existing Power Platform CLI authentication and SQL Server connections
- **Multi-Platform**: Compatible with Claude Desktop, Continue, and other MCP clients

   ```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop** (add to `claude_desktop_config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "power-agent-mcp": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/path/to/Power-Agent-MCP/dist/mcp/server.js"],
         "env": {
           "POWERPLATFORM_TENANT_ID": "your-tenant-id",
           "POWERPLATFORM_APPLICATION_ID": "your-app-id",
           "POWERPLATFORM_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Start using with AI:**
   ```
   "Create a new development environment called 'AI Dev Environment' and export the CustomerPortal solution"
   ```
