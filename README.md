[![Official Build](https://dev.azure.com/dynamicscrm/OneCRM/_apis/build/status%2FDPX-Tools%2Fpowerplatform-build-tools%20Official%20Build?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/dynamicscrm/OneCRM/_build/latest?definitionId=15006&branchName=main)

Power Platform Build Tools automate common build and deployment tasks related to Power Platform.
This includes synchronization of solution metadata (a.k.a. solutions) between development environments and source control,
generating build artifacts, deploying to downstream environments, provisioning/de-provisioning of environments,
and the ability to perform static analysis checks against your solution using the PowerApps checker service.

Learn more about the Build Tools [here](https://aka.ms/buildtoolsdoc).

Each tasks wraps the existing [Power Platform CLI](https://aka.ms/PowerPlatformCLI).

## ðŸ¤– Model Context Protocol (MCP) Support

This repository now includes a comprehensive **MCP server implementation** that exposes all 32 Power Platform Build Tools as MCP tools for AI assistants like Claude. This enables natural language interaction with Power Platform environments through AI assistants.

### MCP Features
- **32 MCP Tools**: Complete coverage of all Power Platform Build Tools tasks
- **Full DevOps Lifecycle**: Environment management, solution development, deployment, governance
- **Production Ready**: Enterprise-grade authentication and error handling
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple setup for Claude Desktop and other MCP clients

### Quick MCP Setup
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Configure Claude Desktop** (add to `claude_desktop_config.json`):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "power-platform": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/path/to/Power-Agent-MCP/dist/mcp/server.js"],
         "env": {
           "POWERPLATFORM_TENANT_ID": "your-tenant-id",
           "POWERPLATFORM_APPLICATION_ID": "your-app-id",
           "POWERPLATFORM_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Start using with AI:**
   ```
   "Create a new development environment called 'AI Dev Environment' and export the CustomerPortal solution"
   ```

### MCP Documentation
- **[MCP Connector Setup Guide](docs/MCP_CONNECTOR_SETUP.md)** - Complete configuration instructions
- **[MCP Commands Reference](docs/MCP_COMMANDS_REFERENCE.md)** - Detailed command documentation  
- **[MCP Commands List](docs/MCP_COMMANDS_LIST.md)** - Quick reference of all 32 commands
