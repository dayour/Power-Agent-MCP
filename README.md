**Power Agent MCP** is an extensible Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants with natural language access to enterprise systems. Starting with complete Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools coverage and expanding to SQL Server database operations, it demonstrates a proven extensibility pattern for integrating any enterprise system into AI workflows.

**Now Enterprise Production Ready** with 100% PAC CLI coverage validation, comprehensive testing, production deployment guides, and proven extensibility through integrated SQL Server capabilities.

## üöÄ What is Power Agent MCP?

Power Agent MCP transforms enterprise system automation by providing:
- **Natural Language Interface**: Control Power Platform, SQL Server, and other enterprise systems through AI conversations
- **Complete DevOps Coverage**: All 32 Power Platform Build Tools as MCP tools
- **SQL Database Operations**: Full CRUD operations and schema management for SQL Server
- **Extensible Architecture**: Proven pattern for integrating additional enterprise systems
- **Enterprise Ready**: Production-grade authentication and error handling
- **Zero Learning Curve**: No need to memorize CLI commands, SQL syntax, or API documentation

Power Agent MCP automates enterprise workflows including Power Platform solution metadata synchronization between development environments and source control, generating build artifacts, deploying to downstream environments, provisioning/de-provisioning of environments, performing static analysis checks using the PowerApps checker service, and managing SQL Server databases with natural language commands.

Each MCP tool wraps enterprise system APIs - including the [Power Platform CLI](https://aka.ms/PowerPlatformCLI) and SQL Server operations - with AI-friendly interfaces, establishing a proven extensibility pattern for any enterprise system integration.

                                       ‚îú‚îÄ SQL Server Driver ‚Üê‚Üí SQL Server Database  
                                       ‚îî‚îÄ [Future Enterprise Systems...]
```

**Extensibility Pattern:**
- **Tool Interface**: Standardized MCP tool schema for any enterprise system
- **Authentication Layer**: Pluggable authentication supporting various enterprise auth methods
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling and async operation patterns
