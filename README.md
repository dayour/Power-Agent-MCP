[![Official Build](https://dev.azure.com/dynamicscrm/OneCRM/_apis/build/status%2FDPX-Tools%2Fpowerplatform-build-tools%20Official%20Build?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/dynamicscrm/OneCRM/_build/latest?definitionId=15006&branchName=main)

**Power Agent MCP** is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes all 32 Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools as AI-accessible tools. This enables AI assistants like Claude to interact naturally with Power Platform environments, automating complex DevOps workflows through simple conversational commands.

**Now Enterprise Production Ready** with 100% PAC CLI coverage validation, comprehensive testing, and production deployment guides.

## üöÄ What is Power Agent MCP?

Power Agent MCP transforms Power Platform operations by providing:
- **Natural Language Interface**: Control Power Platform through AI conversations
- **Complete DevOps Coverage**: All 32 Power Platform Build Tools as MCP tools
- **Enterprise Ready**: Production-grade authentication and error handling
- **Zero Learning Curve**: No need to memorize CLI commands or parameters

Power Agent MCP automates common build and deployment tasks including solution metadata synchronization between development environments and source control, generating build artifacts, deploying to downstream environments, provisioning/de-provisioning of environments, and performing static analysis checks using the PowerApps checker service.

Each MCP tool wraps the existing [Power Platform CLI](https://aka.ms/PowerPlatformCLI) with AI-friendly interfaces.

## üéØ Key Features

- **32 AI-Accessible Tools**: Complete coverage of all Power Platform Build Tools functionality
- **9 Functional Categories**: Environment management, solution development, deployment, governance, and more
- **Enterprise Authentication**: Service Principal, Managed Identity, and Workload Identity Federation support
- **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, async operations, and audit trails
- **Zero Configuration**: Works with existing Power Platform CLI authentication
- **Multi-Platform**: Compatible with Claude Desktop, Continue, and other MCP clients
