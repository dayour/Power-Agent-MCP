# Power Agent MCP - Copilot Studio Integration Guide

## ðŸ¤– Quick Start for Copilot Studio Development

This guide shows you how to use Power Agent MCP to streamline Copilot Studio development and management workflows.

### âš¡ **One-Click Setup for Copilot Studio**

1. **Install Power Agent MCP Extension**
   ```
   VS Code â†’ Extensions â†’ Search "Power Agent MCP" â†’ Install
   ```

2. **Quick Setup**
   ```
   Ctrl+Shift+P â†’ "Power Agent MCP: Quick Setup Power Platform"
   ```
   
3. **Start Creating Copilots!** ðŸŽ‰

### ðŸŽ¯ **Copilot Studio Workflows**

#### **1. Environment Setup for Copilots**
```
"Create a new Power Platform environment called 'Copilot Development Lab'"
"List all available environments and show me which ones have Copilot Studio enabled"
```

#### **2. Copilot Development Lifecycle**
```
"Export the CustomerService copilot solution from the production environment"
"Import the updated CustomerService copilot to the test environment"
"Pack the copilot solution for version control and deployment"
```

#### **3. Conversation Flow Management**
```
"Check my Power Platform authentication status for Copilot Studio"
"List all solutions that contain copilots in the current environment"
"Export all copilot-related solutions for backup"
```

#### **4. Knowledge Base Integration**
```
"Export the KnowledgeBase solution that supports our customer service copilot"
"Import the updated knowledge base solution to integrate with the copilot"
```

#### **5. Custom Actions Development**
```
"Unpack the CustomerActions solution to modify custom copilot actions"
"Pack the updated custom actions solution for deployment"
"Export the complete copilot ecosystem including all dependent solutions"
```

### ðŸ”§ **Supported Copilot Studio Operations**

| **Operation** | **Power Agent MCP Command** | **Description** |
|---------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| **Environment Setup** | `pp_create_environment` | Create dedicated copilot environments |
| **Environment Discovery** | `pp_list_environments` | Find environments with Copilot Studio |
| **Solution Export** | `pp_export_solution` | Export copilot solutions |
| **Solution Import** | `pp_import_solution` | Deploy copilots to environments |
| **Version Control** | `pp_pack_solution` / `pp_unpack_solution` | Source control for copilots |
| **Authentication** | `pp_whoami` / `pp_auth_*` | Manage Power Platform credentials |

### ðŸš€ **Example: Complete Copilot Deployment Pipeline**

Using natural language with your AI assistant:

```markdown
1. "Check my Power Platform authentication and list available environments"

2. "Create a new environment called 'Copilot-Production-V2' for deploying our updated customer service copilot"

3. "Export the CustomerServiceCopilot solution from the development environment and prepare it for production deployment"

4. "Import the CustomerServiceCopilot solution to the Copilot-Production-V2 environment"

5. "Pack all copilot-related solutions for archival and version control"
```

### ðŸŽ¯ **AI Assistant Integration**

#### **Claude Desktop**
Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "power-agent-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/Power-Agent-MCP/dist/mcp/standalone-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### **GitHub Copilot (VS Code)**
Use the Power Agent MCP VS Code extension - automatically integrates with GitHub Copilot Chat.

#### **Continue.dev**
Add to your Continue configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "power-agent-mcp": {
      "command": "node", 
      "args": ["path/to/Power-Agent-MCP/dist/mcp/standalone-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### ðŸ“Š **Copilot Studio Best Practices**

1. **Environment Strategy**
   - Use separate environments for development, testing, and production
   - Create dedicated environments for different copilot projects

2. **Solution Management**
   - Keep copilots and their dependencies in separate solutions
   - Use consistent naming conventions for copilot solutions

3. **Version Control**
   - Pack solutions regularly for source control
   - Export solutions before major changes

4. **Deployment Automation**
   - Use Power Agent MCP for consistent deployment processes
   - Automate environment setup and solution deployment

### ðŸ”’ **Security & Compliance**

- **Enterprise SSO**: Integrates with Azure AD and Enterprise Applications
- **Credential Security**: Uses VS Code SecretStorage for secure credential management
- **Audit Trail**: All operations are logged for compliance tracking
