# Power Agent MCP - Performance and Scalability Guide

## Performance Characteristics

### MCP Server Performance
- **Tool Loading**: 32 tools loaded at startup (~100ms)
- **Tool Execution**: Average response time 500ms-5s (depends on Power Platform operations)
- **Memory Usage**: ~50-100MB base memory footprint
- **Concurrent Requests**: Supports multiple concurrent MCP connections

### Power Platform Operations Performance
- **Environment Operations**: 2-10 minutes (creation, deletion, backup, restore)
- **Solution Operations**: 30 seconds-5 minutes (export, import, pack, unpack)
- **Data Operations**: 1-10 minutes (depends on data volume)
- **Administrative Operations**: 10-60 seconds (user assignment, governance)

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Multiple MCP Instances**: Each AI assistant can have its own MCP server instance
- **Load Distribution**: Different teams can use separate MCP deployments
- **Resource Isolation**: Each instance operates independently

### Vertical Scaling
- **CPU Requirements**: 2+ cores recommended for heavy usage
- **Memory Requirements**: 4GB+ RAM for optimal performance
- **Storage Requirements**: Minimal (logs and temporary files only)

## Production Optimization

### Configuration Tuning
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "power-agent-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["--max-old-space-size=4096", "/path/to/dist/mcp/server.js"],
      "env": {
        "NODE_ENV": "production",
        "POWERPLATFORM_TENANT_ID": "your-tenant-id",
        "POWERPLATFORM_APPLICATION_ID": "your-app-id",
        "POWERPLATFORM_CLIENT_SECRET": "your-client-secret"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
- **Response Time Tracking**: Monitor tool execution times
- **Error Rate Monitoring**: Track failed operations
- **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Power Platform API Limits**: Monitor API call quotas and throttling

### Caching Strategies
- **Authentication Token Caching**: Reuse tokens until expiration
- **Environment Information**: Cache environment details for session duration
- **Solution Metadata**: Cache frequently accessed solution information

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Common Performance Bottlenecks
1. **Power Platform API Throttling**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. **Network Latency**: Ensure optimal network connectivity to Power Platform
3. **Large Solution Files**: Optimize solution packaging and transfer
4. **Concurrent Operations**: Limit concurrent operations to avoid overwhelming APIs

### Performance Tuning Tips
1. **Authentication Optimization**: Use Service Principal for better performance
2. **Batch Operations**: Group related operations when possible
3. **Async Processing**: Leverage async operations for long-running tasks
4. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections where applicable

## Capacity Planning

### Small Team (1-10 users)
- **Single MCP Instance**: Sufficient for development teams
- **Resources**: 2GB RAM, 1 CPU core
- **Expected Load**: 10-50 operations per day

### Medium Organization (10-50 users)
- **Multiple MCP Instances**: One per team or environment
- **Resources**: 4GB RAM, 2 CPU cores per instance
- **Expected Load**: 100-500 operations per day

### Large Enterprise (50+ users)
- **Distributed Deployment**: Multiple instances across regions/teams
- **Resources**: 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores per instance
- **Expected Load**: 500+ operations per day
- **Additional Considerations**: Load balancing, monitoring, automation

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Tool Execution Success Rate**: Should be >95%
- **Average Response Time**: Should be <30 seconds for simple operations
- **Error Rate**: Should be <5%
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU <80%, Memory <80%

### Recommended Alerts
- **High Error Rate**: >10% errors in 5-minute window
- **Slow Response Time**: >60 seconds average response time
- **Resource Exhaustion**: >90% CPU or memory usage
- **Authentication Failures**: Multiple auth failures in short period

## Best Practices

### Development and Testing
- **Load Testing**: Test with expected production load
- **Performance Baselines**: Establish baseline metrics
- **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy to small groups first
- **Monitoring Setup**: Implement monitoring before production

### Production Operations
- **Regular Health Checks**: Automated monitoring of MCP server health
- **Capacity Reviews**: Regular review of resource usage and scaling needs
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuous optimization based on usage patterns
- **Disaster Recovery**: Plan for failover and recovery scenarios
